Additionally, we can see that **India has the largest population in 2022** with China, the United States, Indonesia, and Pakistan rounding out the top five respectively. On the lower end, **Tuvalu had the smallest population in 2022** with Nauru, Palau, the British Virgin Islands, and the French part of St. Martin rounding out the bottom five respectively.\n\n## Life Expectancy\n\nThe next variable I will analyze is **`life_expectancy`**.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwdi_avg_life <- wdi %>% \n  \n  summarize(mean_life_expectancy = mean(life_expectancy, na.rm = TRUE),\n            sd_life_expectancy = sd(life_expectancy, na.rm = TRUE))\nas_tibble(wdi_avg_life)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  mean_life_expectancy sd_life_expectancy\n                 <dbl>              <dbl>\n1                 72.4               7.71\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwdi_life_rank <- wdi %>% \n  select(country, life_expectancy) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(life_expectancy)) %>% \n  arrange(desc(life_expectancy))\nhead(wdi_life_rank, 5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  country              life_expectancy\n  <chr>                          <dbl>\n1 Macao SAR, China                85.4\n2 Liechtenstein                   84.3\n3 Japan                           84.0\n4 Hong Kong SAR, China            83.7\n5 French Polynesia                83.6\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntail(wdi_life_rank, 5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  country                  life_expectancy\n  <chr>                              <dbl>\n1 South Sudan                         55.6\n2 Central African Republic            54.5\n3 Nigeria                             53.6\n4 Lesotho                             53.0\n5 Chad                                53.0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nHere, we see that the average life expectancy across all countries is 72.4165186 years with a standard deviation of 7.7133223. **Macao had the highest life expectancy in 2022** with Liechtenstein, Japan, Hong Kong, and French Polynesia not far behind. On the other end, **Chad had the lowest life expectancy in 2022** with the other bottom five countries being Lesotho, Nigeria, Central African Republic, an South Sudan.\n\n## Measles Immunization Rate\n\nThe final variable I will be analyzing is the **`measles_immunisation_rate`** variable. This variable represents the **percentage of the population age 12 to 23 months that is vaccinated against measles**.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwdi_avg_measles <- wdi %>% \n  summarize(mean_measles_immunisation_rate = mean(measles_immunisation_rate, na.rm = TRUE),\n            sd_measles_immunisation_rate = sd(measles_immunisation_rate, na.rm = TRUE))\nas_tibble(wdi_avg_measles)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  mean_measles_immunisation_rate sd_measles_immunisation_rate\n                           <dbl>                        <dbl>\n1                           83.9                         16.0\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwdi_measles_rank <- wdi %>% \n  select(country, measles_immunisation_rate) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(measles_immunisation_rate)) %>% \n  arrange(desc(measles_immunisation_rate))\nhead(wdi_measles_rank, 5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  country             measles_immunisation_rate\n  <chr>                                   <dbl>\n1 Antigua and Barbuda                        99\n2 Bahrain                                    99\n3 China                                      99\n4 Cuba                                       99\n5 Fiji                                       99\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntail(wdi_measles_rank, 5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  country                   measles_immunisation_rate\n  <chr>                                         <dbl>\n1 Central African Republic                         41\n2 Syrian Arab Republic                             41\n3 Angola                                           37\n4 Montenegro                                       33\n5 Korea, Dem.

I thought it was odd that North Korea had a reported measles immunization rate of 0%. After some research, it appears this is likely a typo in the dataset as data by WHO and UNICEF reported that North Korea had a measles immunization rate of **67% in 2022** [@worldbank].\n\nAdditionally, out of the 193 countries had information regarding measles immunization rates, only **65** of these countries have reached an immunization rate of at least 95%. According to the United States' Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a vaccination rate of 95% of both doses of the measles vaccine means that the population is protected from outbreaks [@CDCmeasles]. This means that 33.679% of countries have  measles immunization rate of at least 95%.\n\n## Plots\n\nNext, I will visualize the variables I discussed above. I will begin with looking at total population for each country and their measles vaccination rate.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![This is a bar graph displaying the total population for each country in the top 15% of populations by measles immunization rate (Source: @worldbank).](Assignment-05_files/figure-html/fig-pop-1.png){#fig-pop width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAbove, I have created @fig-pop, a graph of the countries that have a population in the top 15% of the world in order to make the bar chart easier to view. This then shows each of those countries' total population in billions and whether or not they have achieved a measles vaccination rate of at least 95% or not. It does not appear that total population is related to measles vaccination rate for the countries in the top 15% of total population. It did surprise me to find out that the United States was not at 95% vaccination rate for children age 12 to 23 months in 2022. After some research, I found that kindergarten vaccination rates were above 95% during the 2019 to 2020 school year, but during the 2023-2024 school year dropped back below 95% [@CDCmeaslesUS]. This is due to more parents being wary of vaccines.\n\nNext, I will look at life expectancy and measles vaccination rate.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![This is a bar graph displaying the life expectancy for each country in the top 15% of populations by measles immunization rate (Source: @worldbank).](Assignment-05_files/figure-html/fig-life-1.png){#fig-life width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis is @fig-life. This graph is of the countries that have a population in the top 15% of the world in order to make the bar chart easier to view. This then shows each of those countries' life expectancy and whether or not they have achieved a measles vaccination rate of at least 95% or not. For countries that have a total population within the top 15%, it appears that more countries that do not have a measles vaccination rate of at least 95% have lower life expectancies, although this is just based off visuals and may not be true for the rest of the countries with smaller total populations.\n\nLastly, I will visualize a scatterplot of total population and life expectancy by measles vaccination rates.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![This is a scatter plot showing the relationship between total population and life expectancy by measles immunization rate (Source: @worldbank).](Assignment-05_files/figure-html/fig-scatter-1.png){#fig-scatter width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIn @fig-scatter, you can see the total population of each country in billions vs the country's life expectancy by whether or not they are protected against measles defined as having at least a 95% measles vaccination rate. It is interesting to see that although some countries who are unprotected against measles do have high life expectancies, no country that has at least a 95% vaccination rate against measles has a life expectancy lower than approximately 64 years.\n\n## Table\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-overview .cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<caption>Population and Life Expectancy of Countries by Protection Against Measles</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;font-weight: bold;color: white !important;background-color: rgba(47, 79, 79, 255) !important;\"> Is the Population Protected Against Measles? </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;font-weight: bold;color: white !important;background-color: rgba(47, 79, 79, 255) !important;\"> Average Population </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;font-weight: bold;color: white !important;background-color: rgba(47, 79, 79, 255) !important;\"> Population Standard Deviation </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;font-weight: bold;color: white !important;background-color: rgba(47, 79, 79, 255) !important;\"> Average Life Expectancy </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;font-weight: bold;color: white !important;background-color: rgba(47, 79, 79, 255) !important;\"> Life Expectancy Standard Deviation </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;font-weight: bold;\"> Protected </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 67,689,380 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 248,669,884 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 76.32 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 5.26 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;font-weight: bold;\"> Unprotected </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 28,959,171 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 53,609,898 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 69.27 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 7.51 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAbove, in @tbl-overview, you can see the breakdown of population and life expectancy by whether or not the country has reached the 95% vaccination rate needed to be protected against measles. The average population for unprotected countries is lower but both average populations have a large standard deviation. Additionally, the unprotected countries have a lower life expectancy than protected countries although these overlap when you consider the average life expectancy within one standard deviation.\n\n---\n\n# Conclusions\n\nOverall, this exploratory data analysis gave a good overview of statistics surrounding total population, life expectancy, and measles immunization rates for countries in 2022. Future steps would include regression analysis to determine the significance of the relationships described above.\n\n# References\n\n\n\n",
